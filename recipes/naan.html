    <h6>Naan is a beautiful Indian flatbread.</h6>
    <p>Here’s what you need to make the puffiest, fluffiest, bubbliest naan of your life.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>flour</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>milk</li>
        <li>sugar</li>
        <li>yeast</li>
        <li>ghee or butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Let’s get the yeast activated and ready to work its magic on our naan dough.</li>
        <li>Mix instant yeast with warm water and sugar.</li>
        <li>Leave until foamy – Leave the mixture for 10 minutes until it becomes foamy, which means the yeast is alive and kicking.</li>
        <li>Mix dry and wet ingredients – In a large bowl, mix together the dry ingredients (flour, sugar, salt), then add the foamy yeast, butter / ghee, and the milk + eggs.</li>
        <li>Mix – Start by mixing with a firm rubber spatula or a wooden spoon to bring the dough together.</li>
        <li>Bring together by hand – Once the mixture is too stiff to practically mix with a spatula, switch to hands. You don’t need to knead the dough, just mix it with your hands to bring it together into a cohesive dough.</li>
        <li>Once the dough comes together, it should be sticky and soft enough to easily come together into a ball.</li>
        <li>Proof dough – Once the butter / ghee is incorporated, shape dough into a ball. Cover with cling-wrap then put the bowl somewhere warm to let it proof – about 1 – 1.5 hours, until it has doubled in volume.</li>
        <li>Cut into six pieces – Lift the dough out of the bowl on to a lightly floured surface. Cut into 6 equal pieces. This makes ~15 – 16 cm / 6 – 6.5″ diameter naans which are a nice individual serving size and comfortably cooked in a skillet.</li>
        <li>Shape into balls – Make the top surface smooth by tucking the dough surface to the base.</li>
        <li>Rise 15 minutes, 50% increase in size – Place the balls on a lightly floured tray, and cover loosely with a a lightweight tea towel (ie just place it on top, don’t tuck it tightly under the tray). Leave to rise in a warm place for 15 minutes until they increase in size by about 50%.</li>
        <li>Flatten on lightly floured surface – Pick up a piece and flat it down lightly on a lightly floured surface.</li>
        <li>Roll out into  3 – 4mm / 0.12 – 0.16″ thick rounds (about 16cm / 6.5″ wide).</li>
        <li>Heat a well-seasoned* cast iron skillet over medium-high heat until it is just starting to smoke. Then place the naan in and leave to cook without touching.</li>
        <li>60 to 90 seconds cooking, then flip – It should only take 60 – 90 seconds for the underside to cook until it’s nicely browned. Then use tongs to turn.</li>
        <li>Brush with ghee or butter (optionally also garlic – but yes you absolutely should!) –- Remove naan from the stove, then brush with melted ghee or butter while it’s still hot. Garlic is an optional extra, but it’s so good!</li>
    </ol>
